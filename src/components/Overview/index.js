        November is one of the best times to visit Kenya, especially to visit its prime park, Maasai Mara. This is because the large migratory herds would have returned to Tanzania, and now the Big Cats have to venture long distances to hunt their prey.
      </p>
      <p>
        November is also the season of short rains. This makes the plains of Maasai Mara lush green. The skies are truly dramatic and colorful. The sunrise and sunset during November at Mara are simply breathtaking.

        Join us on this unforgettable journey of your lifetime.
